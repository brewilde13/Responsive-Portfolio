			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="https://github.com/brewilde13/Basic-Portfolio/blob/master/assets/images/Brooke1.jpg?raw=true" alt="Brooke Bio Picture">
			<p>Hi! My name is Brooke Wildermuth. Born and raised in Cincinnati (Ohio), Indiana University alumni, University of Michigan dieheart fan, and current Chicago resident - I cover all of the Midwest and don't anticipate leaving any time soon! I have 3 sisters (I know, my poor dad) and two loving parents. I currently work in the Finance industry as a consultant specializing in Operational Risk but have high hopes of switching career paths into a more fulfilling role.</p>

			<p>Outside of work, I enjoy running, painting, enjoying the outdoors (skiing, hiking, biking), playing the piano and spending time with my family and friends. Some fun facts about me include:

			<ul>

				<li>1) Of my three sisters, I am the only brunette. They are all bleach blonde (naturally) and my older sister used to convince me that I was adopted whenever she was mad (which was more often than not!)</li>

				<br>

				<li>2) I punctured my spleen in the 3rd grade playing soccer.</li>

				<br>

				<li>3) I eat a piece of chocolate almost every single day.</li>

			</ul>

			</p>
